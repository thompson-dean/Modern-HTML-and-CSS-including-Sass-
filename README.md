#### Studying my way through Brad Traversy's Udemy course "Modern HTML &amp; CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass)" 

It is great to see how far my code has come along through the process.

### Section Information

|Section|Topics and Challenges|Screenshots|
|:--|:--|:--:|
|Section 1: **Introduction**| How to set up VSCode. I skipped this section as I had learnt this before.|*No Screenshots*|
|Section 2 **HTML Basics**| It had been a while since I had used HTML so I decided to not skip this section and study all of the following concepts from scratch. This section also included a challenge, but I felt it was to simple so I decided to make my own basic HTML website on top of the challenge. <br> <br> *Doctype & Basic Layout,Setting Up Live Server (VSCode Extension), Meta Tags & Search Engines, Headings, Paragraphs & Typography, Links, Images & Attributes, Lists & Tables, Forms & Input, Block & Inline Level Elements, Divs & Spans, Classes & Ids, HTML Entities, and HTML5 Semantic Tags.* |<img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/Modern-HTML-and-CSS-including-Sass-/blob/main/02_HTML_Basics/screenshots/screen01.png" width=100% height=100%> |
|Section 3 **CSS Basics**| This section was really fun to study. As with HTML it had been a while since I had used CSS so I decided to run through each lesson. There was a fun challenge at the end where we were asked to make a login screen and center the div. I found the that Brad gave away too many hints in the challenge so I completed it from scratch then aftwerwards checked out his answer to the challenge. Both answers are in the CSS Basics folder.<br> <br>*Basic CSS Selectors, Fonts In CSS, Color Types, Backgrounds & Borders, Box Model, Margin & Padding, Float & Alignment, Link State & Button Styling, Navigation Menu Styling, Inline, Block & Inline-Block Display, Positioning, Form Style Challenge, Form Style Solution, Aside: Visibility, Order & Negative Margin*|
