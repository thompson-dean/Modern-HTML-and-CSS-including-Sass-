#### Studying my way through Brad Traversy's Udemy course "Modern HTML &amp; CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass)" 

It is great to see how far my code has come along through the process.

### Section Information

|Section|Topics and Challenges|Screenshots|
|:--|:--|:--:|
|Section 1: **Introduction**| How to set up VSCode. I skipped this section as I had learnt this before.|*No Screenshots*|
|Section 2 **HTML Basics**| It had been a while since I had used HTML so I decided to not skip this section and study all of the following concepts from scratch. This section also included a challenge, but I felt it was to simple so I decided to make my own basic HTML website on top of the challenge. <br> <br> *Doctype & Basic Layout,Setting Up Live Server (VSCode Extension), Meta Tags & Search Engines, Headings, Paragraphs & Typography, Links, Images & Attributes, Lists & Tables, Forms & Input, Block & Inline Level Elements, Divs & Spans, Classes & Ids, HTML Entities, and HTML5 Semantic Tags.* |<img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/Modern-HTML-and-CSS-including-Sass-/blob/main/02_HTML_Basics/screenshots/screen01.png" width=100% height=100%> |
|Section 3 **CSS Basics**| This section was really fun to study. As with HTML it had been a while since I had used CSS so I decided to run through each lesson. There was a fun challenge at the end where we were asked to make a login screen and center the div. I found the that Brad gave away too many hints in the challenge so I completed it from scratch then aftwerwards checked out his answer to the challenge. Both answers are in the CSS Basics folder.<br> <br>*Basic CSS Selectors, Fonts In CSS, Color Types, Backgrounds & Borders, Box Model, Margin & Padding, Float & Alignment, Link State & Button Styling, Navigation Menu Styling, Inline, Block & Inline-Block Display, Positioning, Form Style Challenge, Form Style Solution, Aside: Visibility, Order & Negative Margin*| <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/Modern-HTML-and-CSS-including-Sass-/blob/main/03_CSS_Basics/screenshots/screen01.png" width=50% height=50%> |
|Section 4: **Hotel Website** | This lesson used all of our knowledge from the previous to lessons to make a three page hotel website. This lesson gave me a greater understanding of how to lay out HTML tags and how to properly name CSS ids and classes. Looking forward to learning responsive design as that will be out of my knowledge coming into this course. | <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/Modern-HTML-and-CSS-including-Sass-/blob/main/04_Hotel_Website/screenshots/screen01.png" width=50% height=50%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/Modern-HTML-and-CSS-including-Sass-/blob/main/04_Hotel_Website/screenshots/screen02.png" width=50% height=50%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/Modern-HTML-and-CSS-including-Sass-/blob/main/04_Hotel_Website/screenshots/screen03.png" width=50% height=50%>
